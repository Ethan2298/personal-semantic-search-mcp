# Dev Session: 2025-12-14

## Session Info
- **Started:** 2:00 PM
- **Ended:** 2:30 PM
- **Focus:** Fix cold-start delay (Issue #1)

## Context Recovery
Previously diagnosed that MCP tool calls return empty because:
- Server takes ~10s to load sentence-transformers model
- Lazy loading means first tool call triggers the delay
- Claude Code may timeout waiting

## Work Log

### 2:00 PM — Session Start
- Created GitHub issue #1
- Set up docs/ folder structure following TDD workflow
- Created _status.md for context recovery

### 2:15 PM — TDD Cycle
- 🔴 Ran existing tests → 5 tests fail (warmup not implemented)
- 🟢 Implemented `warmup()` function in mcp_server.py
- ✅ All 5 tests pass (10.45s total, includes model load)
- 🔵 No refactoring needed (minimal implementation)
- 📦 Commit pending

### Implementation
Added `warmup()` function that:
1. Loads embedding model via `get_model()`
2. Initializes ChromaDB via `init_db()`
3. Logs timing for visibility

Called `warmup()` before `mcp.run()` in main block.

## Summary
- **Commits:** 1 (pending)
- **Issues closed:** #1, #2, #3, #4
- **Tests:** 30 passing
